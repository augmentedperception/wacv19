## Description
The emergence of virtual and augmented reality has increased the demand of robust systems for 3D capture, reconstruction and understanding. Designing such systems involves developing high quality sensors and efficient algorithms that can leverage new and existing technologies. To this end, we design depth sensors with two properties that drastically simplify the problem of fusing incomplete sensor data. First, an UltraFast depth stream that significantly reduces the frame to frame motion. Second, by allowing multiple sensors to be easily combined (without interference) we can eliminate occlusions. As a result, we have developed a wide range of efficient algorithms for reconstruction, tracking and understanding that are designed to work with this technology. In this tutorial we will walk the audience through the ins and outs of building such a stack from the ground up. From building such a sensor to applications for mixed reality with particular emphasis on high speed 3D capture systems.
